# ACO
Solving Travelling Salesman Problem using Ant Colony Optimization

1. Import Libraries:
- numpy is imported to handle numerical operations efficiently.
- random is imported to generate random numbers for choosing initial cities for ants.
2. Define Distance Matrix:
- The distance_matrix represents the distances between cities. This is the input data for the TSP problem.
- Each element distance_matrix[i][j] represents the distance from city i to city j.
3. Parameters for ACO:
- num_ants: Number of ants to be deployed in each iteration.
- num_iterations: Number of iterations to run the ACO algorithm.
- evaporation_rate: Rate at which pheromone evaporates. It controls the forgetting of old pheromone trails.
- pheromone_constant and heuristic_constant: Parameters that control the importance of pheromone trails and heuristic information (visibility), respectively.
4. Initialize Pheromone and Visibility Matrices:
- pheromone: A matrix representing the amount of pheromone on each edge. Initialized with ones to represent equal initial pheromone levels on all edges.
- visibility: A matrix representing the attractiveness of each edge, calculated as the inverse of the distance between cities.
5. ACO Algorithm:
- The algorithm iterates num_iterations times.
- In each iteration, num_ants are deployed.
- For each ant:
-- A random starting city is chosen.
-- The ant constructs a route by selecting the next city probabilistically based on pheromone levels and visibility information until all cities are visited.
- After all ants complete their routes, pheromone levels are updated:
-- delta_pheromone is calculated for each edge based on the routes of all ants.
-- Pheromone levels are updated by adding delta_pheromone and applying evaporation.
6. Return the Result:
- The loop terminates after the specified number of iterations.
- The pheromone matrix, which represents the solution, is returned.
